\section{Abstract}
Time series forecasting is an interesting subject in the field of machine learning, posing many of the widely seen problems in the commonly used machine learning methods. This project explores the \textit{transformer}, a model architecture implementing the concept of \textit{attention}, and compares it to some of the most widely used methods in the domain of time series data.\\
In this project, a comparison is explored between the widely used \textit{Long Short Term Memory} neural network, a form of gated recurrent neural network that should be able to learn long term dependencies, and the transformer with its attention feature. Though a clear and precise conclusion can not be made on the basis of lackluster experimentation and choices made in the use of the dataset, however the results gave a clear indication that the transformer and attention are important concepts that have a definite place in the field of time series forecasting.
